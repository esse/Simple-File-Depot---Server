Welcome to Simple File Depot.

This is small application, designed to serve as simple file exchange system (for example between students).

On my other repo, you can find windows client (C#) which notify when new file arrives, etc. Everything was developed, having really user friendliness in mind.

Requirements:
Ruby 1.8.7
Ruby On Rails 2.3.5
Paperclip
Haml

All configuration (also user and password for http basic auth) can be set in config/config.yml.

For client, look here: http://github.com/esse/Simple-File-Depot---Client
